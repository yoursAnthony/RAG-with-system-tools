Title: Volcanoes

Volcanoes are ruptures in Earth's crust that allow hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from magma chambers below the surface. Most volcanoes occur at tectonic plate boundaries. Famous volcanoes include Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed Pompeii in 79 AD, and Mount St. Helens, which erupted in 1980. Volcanic eruptions can be both destructive and beneficial.
