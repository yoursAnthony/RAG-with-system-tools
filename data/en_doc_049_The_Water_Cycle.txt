Title: The Water Cycle

The water cycle, or hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. Key processes include evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. The sun drives the water cycle by heating water in oceans, rivers, and lakes. The water cycle is essential for distributing fresh water and regulating climate.
