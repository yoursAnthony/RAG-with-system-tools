Title: Magnetism

Magnetism is a physical phenomenon produced by the motion of electric charge, resulting in attractive and repulsive forces between objects. Every magnet has two poles: north and south. Opposite poles attract while like poles repel. Earth itself acts as a giant magnet with magnetic north and south poles, which is why compasses work.
