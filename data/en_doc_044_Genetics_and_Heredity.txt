Title: Genetics and Heredity

Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants in the 1860s established the fundamental laws of inheritance. Modern genetics includes molecular genetics, population genetics, and genetic engineering. Understanding genetics has led to advances in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.
