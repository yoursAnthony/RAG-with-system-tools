Title: Plate Tectonics

Plate tectonics is the theory explaining the structure and motion of Earth's lithosphere. The lithosphere is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath. The movement of these plates causes earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and ocean trench formation.
