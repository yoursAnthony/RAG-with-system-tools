Title: Glaciers

Glaciers are persistent bodies of dense ice constantly moving under their own weight. They form where snow accumulation exceeds melting over many years. Glaciers cover about 10% of Earth's land surface and contain about 75% of the world's fresh water. They shape landscapes, affect sea levels, and are sensitive indicators of climate change.
