Title: Mountains

Mountains are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, typically having steep slopes and considerable height. They form through tectonic forces, volcanic activity, or erosion. Mountains affect climate by blocking air masses and creating rain shadows. They are home to unique ecosystems and contain important freshwater sources.
