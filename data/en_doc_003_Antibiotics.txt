Title: Antibiotics

Antibiotics are medicines that fight bacterial infections by either killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to antibiotic resistance, where bacteria evolve to withstand these medicines, posing a significant global health threat.
