Title: Renewable Energy

Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions. As technology advances and costs decrease, renewable energy is increasingly becoming competitive with traditional energy sources.
