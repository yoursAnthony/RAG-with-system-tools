Title: Wetlands

Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil or is present at or near the surface for part or all of the year. Types include marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens. Wetlands provide critical ecosystem services including flood control, water filtration, carbon storage, and habitat for diverse wildlife. Many wetlands face threats from development and pollution.
