Title: Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions. Types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications range from image recognition to natural language processing.
