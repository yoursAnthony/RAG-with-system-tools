Title: Climate Change

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily through burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases. The consequences include rising temperatures, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events.
