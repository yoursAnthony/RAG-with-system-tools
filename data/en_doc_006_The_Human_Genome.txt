Title: The Human Genome

The human genome is the complete set of genetic information for humans, encoded as DNA. It consists of about 3 billion base pairs and contains approximately 20,000-25,000 genes. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, successfully mapped the entire human genome, opening new frontiers in medicine and understanding human biology.
