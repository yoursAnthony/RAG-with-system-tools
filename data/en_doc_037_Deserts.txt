Title: Deserts

Deserts are arid regions receiving very little precipitation, typically less than 10 inches per year. They cover about one-third of Earth's land surface. Deserts can be hot like the Sahara or cold like Antarctica. Despite harsh conditions, deserts support specialized plants and animals adapted to extreme temperatures and water scarcity.
