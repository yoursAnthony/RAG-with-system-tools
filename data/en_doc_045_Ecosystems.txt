Title: Ecosystems

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Energy flows through ecosystems via food chains and food webs, from producers (plants) to consumers (animals) to decomposers. Ecosystems provide essential services including oxygen production, water purification, and climate regulation. Biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem health.
