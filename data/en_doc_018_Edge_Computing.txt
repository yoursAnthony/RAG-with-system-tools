Title: Edge Computing

Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, reducing latency and bandwidth use. Instead of sending data to centralized cloud servers, processing occurs on local devices or edge servers. This is crucial for IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and applications requiring real-time processing.
