Title: Tropical Rainforests

Tropical rainforests are dense forests found near the equator, characterized by high rainfall (at least 80 inches annually) and year-round warm temperatures. They contain the highest biodiversity of any terrestrial ecosystem, housing millions of plant, animal, and insect species. Major rainforests include the Amazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asian forests.
