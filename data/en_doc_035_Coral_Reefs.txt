Title: Coral Reefs

Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems formed by coral polyps, which secrete calcium carbonate to create hard skeletons. They are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, supporting about 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. Reefs face threats from climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution.
