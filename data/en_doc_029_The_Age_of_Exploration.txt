Title: The Age of Exploration

The Age of Exploration (15th-17th centuries) was a period when European nations explored the world by sea, searching for new trading routes and territories. Portuguese and Spanish explorers led the way, followed by Dutch, French, and English. This era connected previously isolated parts of the world but also led to colonization and exploitation.
