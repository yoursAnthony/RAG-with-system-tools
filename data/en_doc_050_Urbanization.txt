Title: Urbanization

Urbanization is the process by which rural areas become more urban, typically involving population migration to cities. Over half the world's population now lives in urban areas. Urbanization brings economic opportunities and improved services but also challenges including congestion, pollution, housing shortages, and strain on infrastructure. Sustainable urban planning is increasingly important.
